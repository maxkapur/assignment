# assignment

This module provides a lightweight implementation of the Gale-Shapley stable assignment (proposal) algorithm and a few tools for exploring the stable assignment polytope, including a modified implementation of the optimal stable marriage algorithm described by Irving et al. (1987). 

Please see the Jupyter notebooks in the root directory for a discussion of the rotation algorithm and usage examples.
